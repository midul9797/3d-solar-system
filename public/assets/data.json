    "name": "earth",
    "details": "Earth, positioned as the third celestial body from the Sun, follows an elliptical orbit spanning an average distance of 149.6 million kilometers. This orbital path introduces seasonal variations, with Earth reaching its closest point, perihelion, at 147 million kilometers, and its farthest, aphelion, at 152 million kilometers. In tandem, our natural satellite, the Moon, gracefully orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 kilometers. Despite this proximity, Earth and the Moon engage in a gravitational duet, resulting in tidal phenomena that shape our planet's shores. The Moon's orbit, deviating from a perfect circle, oscillates between perigee, the closest point at 363,300 kilometers, and apogee, the farthest at 405,500 kilometers. These intricate cosmic relationships, intricately woven by celestial mechanics, not only orchestrate the rhythm of seasons and tides, but also offer profound insights into the dynamics governing our vast solar system."
